## User Stories

#On the medical consultation platform, the patient begins their journey by searching for the right doctor.
They can type keywords like ‚ÄúPsychiatrist‚Äù or ‚ÄúGeneral Practitioner‚Äù into the search bar, or use filters to choose a specific specialty and preferred doctor gender (male or female).

Once the results appear, the patient selects a doctor and is taken to a detailed profile page.
Here, they can see the doctor's full name, specialty, consultation fee, years of experience, and gender.

If the patient is satisfied, they click the ‚ÄúBook Appointment‚Äù button.
They are directed to a form where they enter their personal information: full name, age, weight, height, gender, a description of their health condition, and their preferred appointment date.

After submitting the form, a confirmation page appears showing all appointment details, with the status marked as Pending (awaiting the doctor‚Äôs response).

Later, the doctor logs into their private dashboard using their email or ID.
They view the list of pending appointments, open one, and review the patient's information.

The doctor then writes a response, including a diagnosis and any treatment suggestions, and submits it.

Finally, the appointment status is updated to Completed, and the patient is notified that a response is now available.
